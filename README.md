A proof of concept.

**WIP**
-------

Todo List (Language wise):
- [x] Term, Const
- [x] Application
- [x] Abstraction
- [x] Let
- [ ] Haskell Style Multi Def Let
- [x] Fix
- [ ] Pairs, Record Types
- [ ] Disjoint Union Types
- [ ] Rule Rewriting (Pattern Matching)
- [ ] User Defined Operators
- [ ] Type Classes
- [ ] ML-Style Classes

Ideas (Not sure if should be implemented):
- [ ] Local Mutable Variables (Ability to define mutable variables that stays only in the current scope and cannot be captured by closures)
- [ ] C/C++ Interface
- [ ] Compilability (Should it be compiled or is it fine to let it run inside an intepreter)

System:
- [x] Parser
- [x] Type Checker
- [ ] Intepreter/Compiler (see above)
